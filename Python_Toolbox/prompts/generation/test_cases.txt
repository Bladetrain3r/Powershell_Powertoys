Generate practical test cases for this code:

UNIT TESTS: [Test individual functions with specific inputs/outputs]
EDGE CASES: [Boundary conditions, null/empty inputs, invalid data]
ERROR HANDLING: [Exception scenarios and error conditions]
INTEGRATION TESTS: [Component interactions if applicable]
VALIDATION TESTS: [Input validation and data integrity]

Focus on realistic test scenarios that would actually be implemented.
